# HEART DISEASE PREDICTION

## PROJECT ABSTRCT
Predicting heart disease has become a critical focus of healthcare research due to its high prevalence and significant impact on public health. Early detection of heart disease can significantly reduce the risk of severe outcomes by enabling timely intervention and personalized treatment plans. This project aims to develop a predictive model for heart disease using machine learning techniques. By analyzing a dataset of patient health records, which includes various features such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and lifestyle factors, the model will predict the likelihood of a patient developing heart disease. The project will utilize various algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests, to identify patterns and risk factors associated with heart disease. The goal is to create a user-friendly tool that healthcare professionals can use to make more informed decisions regarding patient care. Additionally, this predictive model seeks to improve patient outcomes through early intervention and personalized risk management strategies.

## ABOUT DATASET
This dataset gives information related to heart disease. The dataset contains 13 columns, target is the class variable which is affected by the other 12 columns. Here the aim is to classify the target variable to (disease\non disease) using different machine learning algorithms and find out which algorithm is suitable for this dataset.
## HOW DATASET GENERATED
The make_classification function in Python, part of the sklearn.datasets module, is commonly used to simulate classification datasets for testing machine learning algorithms. It allows you to generate synthetic datasets with a specified number of features, classes, informative and redundant features, and noise. This is particularly useful when you want to experiment with classification models and benchmark their performance using controlled, generated data.

Hereâ€™s how you can simulate data using the make_classification function:
```bash
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
```
